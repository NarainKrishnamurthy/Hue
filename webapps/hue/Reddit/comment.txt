You could hear gunshots in the background.\n\nThese people are actually worse than the Nightcrawler.'}, {'text': u"I remember the day after it happened (10th of January) the wife of one of the hostages has been interviewed live in front of the supermarket by the same news channel, she took the opportunity to reveal to the world how they were broadcasting their location live during the siege and express how she feels about those journalistic methods. \n\n[Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmSCOaP8Rk4), by the end you can feel the awkardeness in the journalist's eyes.\n\n\nEDIT : I guess it deserves some translation : \n\nJournalist : I'm here with the wife of an hostage, tell us how you feel\n\nWoman : It was atrocious, waiting for my husband for 5 hours, and fortunately he got out okay.\n\nJ : Were where you when it happened ?\n\nW : With the police, at the back door... And... That's it. *sigh*... But I've got to say, you made a really, really big mistake yesterday, BFM. You were live on phone with the people hiding in the freezer, they told you they were HIDING, with a baby furthermore and two minutes later it was live on BFMTV, written on the news ticker, while the terrorist was watching BFMTV. Thank God he wasn't reading the crawl, because if he did, he would have gone down and killed everybody. Too much news kill the news."}, {'text': u"The sad thing is it's not going to change. We will see this happen again. And when it goes very, very wrong because of something like this, the media will make a big deal out of the media, complete with interviews and analysis about the media's role in it."}, {'text': u'This may not be super relevant but during the Ut\xf6ya massacre Swedish and Norwegian news television implored their watchers not to try and call their friends\' cell phones if someone they knew was on the island, because "if they\'ve managed to run and hide the killer might find them if he hears their cell phones ring." \n\nJust sitting there on my ass, watching the news reporter say that... It was like something out of a horror movie. :('}, {'text': u"I hope they win, that's an incredibly irresponsible &amp; stupid thing to do. "}, {'text': u"&gt;Klugman singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV, which revealed live on air that the group -- including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby -- was hiding from Coulibaly in the cold room, where they were taken by one of the supermarket's employees.\n\nAll it would have taken is for one of the terrorist's associates to be watching the news (as everyone seemed to be at that time), made a phone call and it'd have been a grim end for all six. Incredibility stupid and reckless. "}]}
